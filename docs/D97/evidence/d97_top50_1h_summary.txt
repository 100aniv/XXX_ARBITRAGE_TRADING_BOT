Overall Status: CONDITIONAL PASS
- Performance targets met (RT, PnL, WinRate)
- Duration exceeded target (80min vs 60min target)
- KPI JSON file not generated (runner script issue)

Issue Identified:
- KPI output file was not created at docs/D97/evidence/d97_top50_1h_kpi.json
- Runner script may have failed to write JSON on completion
- Manual termination after 80 minutes

Recommendation:
- D97 performance validated (24 RT, $9.92 PnL, ~100% WR)
- Fix KPI JSON output in runner script for future runs
- Proceed to D98 (Production Readiness) with monitoring
